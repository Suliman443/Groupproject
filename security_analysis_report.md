# Preliminary Security Risk Assessment Report
## Event Management System

### Executive Summary
This report provides a preliminary security risk assessment for the Event Management System, identifying critical assets, potential vulnerabilities, and recommended security controls.

### System Overview
The system is a Flask-based web application with:
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript served via Flask proxy
- **Backend**: Flask REST API with SQLite database
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **Core Features**: User management, event management, listings, comments, bookings

### Asset Analysis

#### 1. Critical Assets Identified

**A. Data Assets**
- **User Data**: Email addresses, hashed passwords, full names, roles
- **Event Data**: Event details, locations, dates, descriptions, images
- **Listing Data**: Product/service listings with prices, locations, images
- **Comment Data**: User-generated content and feedback
- **Booking Data**: User reservations and booking history
- **Database**: SQLite database file containing all persistent data

**B. Application Assets**
- **Authentication System**: JWT tokens, password hashing mechanisms
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful services for data access and manipulation
- **Configuration**: Secret keys, database connections, JWT settings
- **Source Code**: Application logic and business rules

**C. Infrastructure Assets**
- **Web Server**: Flask application server
- **Database Server**: SQLite database engine
- **Network**: HTTP/HTTPS communication channels
- **File System**: Static files, images, configuration files

#### 2. Security Risk Assessment

**HIGH RISK VULNERABILITIES:**

1. **Weak Secret Key Management**
   - Risk: Hardcoded secret keys in configuration
   - Impact: Token forgery, session hijacking
   - Likelihood: High

2. **SQLite Database Security**
   - Risk: No database-level authentication
   - Impact: Direct database access if file is compromised
   - Likelihood: Medium

3. **Insufficient Input Validation**
   - Risk: Potential SQL injection, XSS attacks
   - Impact: Data breach, unauthorized access
   - Likelihood: Medium

4. **Missing Data Encryption**
   - Risk: Sensitive data stored in plaintext
   - Impact: Data exposure if database is compromised
   - Likelihood: High

**MEDIUM RISK VULNERABILITIES:**

5. **CORS Configuration**
   - Risk: Overly permissive CORS settings
   - Impact: Cross-origin attacks
   - Likelihood: Low

6. **Error Information Disclosure**
   - Risk: Detailed error messages in responses
   - Impact: Information leakage
   - Likelihood: Medium

7. **Missing Rate Limiting**
   - Risk: Brute force attacks on authentication
   - Impact: Account compromise
   - Likelihood: Medium

**LOW RISK VULNERABILITIES:**

8. **File Upload Security**
   - Risk: Unvalidated file uploads
   - Impact: Malicious file execution
   - Likelihood: Low

### Security Controls Assessment

#### Current Security Measures
✅ **Implemented:**
- Password hashing using PBKDF2-SHA256
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (user, organizer, admin)
- Basic input validation
- CORS enabled
- Error handling middleware

❌ **Missing:**
- Database encryption
- Rate limiting
- Input sanitization
- Security headers
- Audit logging
- Session management
- File upload validation

### Risk Matrix

| Asset | Threat | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level |
|-------|--------|------------|--------|------------|
| User Credentials | Brute Force | Medium | High | **HIGH** |
| Database | Direct Access | Medium | High | **HIGH** |
| API Endpoints | Injection Attacks | Medium | Medium | **MEDIUM** |
| JWT Tokens | Token Forgery | High | High | **HIGH** |
| File Uploads | Malicious Files | Low | Medium | **LOW** |

### Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. Implement database encryption for sensitive fields
2. Strengthen secret key management
3. Add comprehensive input validation
4. Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints

#### Short-term Actions (Medium Priority)
1. Add security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
2. Implement audit logging
3. Add file upload validation
4. Enhance error handling to prevent information disclosure

#### Long-term Actions (Low Priority)
1. Migrate to PostgreSQL with proper authentication
2. Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting
3. Add automated security testing
4. Implement backup encryption

### Compliance Considerations
- **Data Protection**: Implement encryption for PII
- **Access Control**: Strengthen authentication mechanisms
- **Audit Trail**: Implement comprehensive logging
- **Data Retention**: Define data lifecycle policies

### Conclusion
The system has basic security measures in place but requires significant improvements to meet enterprise security standards. Priority should be given to implementing database encryption, strengthening authentication, and adding comprehensive input validation.
